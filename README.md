This is a web app I designed that collects different shows/events in the Atlanta area and brings them all to one place. It runs on a railway backend using Postgres and python. It pulls data from Ticketmaster's API and the BandsinTown API. I incorporated an Admin page as well that I can copy and paste data from smaller venues into and the app will parse the data and extract the shows in a row/column format.
