This is a web app I designed that collects different shows/events in the Atlanta area and brings them all to one place. The backend runs on Railway using Postgres and python. It pulls data from Ticketmaster's API and the BandsinTown API. I incorporated an Admin page as well that I can copy and paste data from venues that don't use an API ticket provider. The app will parse the data and extract the shows in a row/column format. I tried using data scrapers, but most sites these days have very good security and data scraping was inconsistent. Manually copy and pasting has proven to be more accurate. This is still in beta and not publicly shared.
